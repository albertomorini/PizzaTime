# PizzaTime a basic pizza's orders manager

This has been my high school project in 2018.. Then sorry for the quality of the code :/

## How PizzaTime works?
This webapp allows to digitalize orders for pizzerias.

A pizzeria put its menÃ¹ and location, then customers will see the pizzerias near them (need to allow location), then chosen a pizzeria and they will see an interactive menu where they will be able to select the pizza they like.

Next, customers will pick a time and a way to get the pizza (deliver, take away, table).. The pizzeria will get the order and can change the time if it's not possible to perform it.

The status (accepted/modified/declined) of the order is visible both from customers and pizzeria, the pizzeria will get also an analysis of how much it earn and which are the pizzas more taken.
